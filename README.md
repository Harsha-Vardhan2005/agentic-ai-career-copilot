## 💡 Project Idea / Overview

**The Problem:**  
Students and early-career professionals struggle to make clear career decisions due to scattered guidance, unclear skill priorities, and lack of interview readiness. Current platforms don't provide continuous mentorship, personalized skill prioritization, or realistic interview feedback.

- 🧠 **Continuously analyzing** your resume, skills, interests, and career goals
- 🎯 **Reasoning about** job market needs and role feasibility  
- 📊 **Planning skill roadmaps** using our unique **Skill ROI framework** (prioritizing skills with highest career payoff)
- 🎤 **Conducting voice-based mock interviews** with real-time speech analytics
- 🔍 **Detecting career drift** to identify and correct misaligned learning paths early
- 🚀 **Actively recommending** jobs, internships, and hackathons tailored to your profile

**From Career Confusion → Job Readiness**
